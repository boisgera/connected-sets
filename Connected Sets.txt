**TODO:**

  - study the introduction of "non-uniform dilation" (is it convenient/worth it?)

  - get rid of "disconnected" term ?

  - handle better the explanation of "subset of a normed space" generalization.
    Present the real line as a special case of it (instead of year another
    variant)?

-----

We characterize the subsets of the plane that are "in one piece".
Two slightly different mathematical properties can play this role:
*path-connectedness*, whose definition is quite elementary, 
and *connectedness*, a slightly weaker -- and arguably more convoluted -- 
property, but also a more robust and powerful one. 
The difference matters only when one deals with "pathological" sets;
for "well-behaved" sets -- and that includes all open sets --
the two properties are equivalent.

In this document, we use the word "set" to mean "subset of the (complex) plane".
Everything still works if instead "set" means "subset of the (real) line";
we only have to replace every mention to an open disk $D(a, r)$ 
by a mention of the open interval $\left]a-r, a+r \right[$[^metric]. 

[^metric]: More generally, if "set" is interpreted as 
"subset of a normed vector space", everything still works if we replace 
every mention to an open disk $D(a,r)$ by a mention to the open ball $B(a, r)$.


Path-Connected/Connected Sets 
================================================================================

**Definition -- Path-Connected.** 
A set $A$ is *path-connected* if any pair of points of $A$ can be joined by a 
path of $A$:
  $$
  \forall \, (w, z) \in A^2, \, 
  \exists \, \gamma \in C^0([0,1], A), \,
  \gamma(0) = w \, \land \, \gamma(1) = z.
  $$

**Definition -- Connected.**
A set is *connected* if for any collection $(D_a)_{a \in A}$ of non-empty open 
disks centered on $a\in A$, the set $\cup_{a \in A} D_a$ is path-connected. 
A set that is not connected is *disconnected*.

**Theorem -- Path-Connected/Connected.**
Every path-connected set is connected.
Conversely, every open connected set is path-connected.

**Proof.** Let $A$ be a path-connected set and let $(D_a)_{a \in A}$ be a 
collection of non-empty open disks centered on $a\in A$. 
For any pair of points $w$ and $z$ in $\cup_{a \in A} D_a$, 
there are points $a$ and $b$ in $A$ such that $w \in D_a$ and $z \in D_b$. 
There is a path that joins $w$ and $a$ in $D_a$, 
a path that joins $a$ and $b$ in $A$ and 
a path that joins $b$ and $z$ in $D_b$. 
The sum of these paths joins $w$ and $z$ in $\cup_{a \in A} D_a$,
hence, $A$ is connected.

Conversely, let $A$ be an open connected set. 
For any $a\in A$, the distance $d_a$ between $a$ and the complement of $A$,
a closed set, is positive, 
hence the disk $D_a = D(a, d_a)$ is non-empty. 
As $A = \cup_{a \in A} D_a$, $A$ is path-connected. \hfill $\blacksquare$

**Corollary.** An open set is connected if and only if it is path-connected.


Basic Properties
================================================================================

Many properties of connected sets are similar to properties of path-connected 
sets, so many statements exist in two variant forms. For example:

**Theorem -- Union of Path-Connected/Connected Sets.** 
if $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection of path-connected/connected sets
whose intersection $\cap \mathcal{A}$ is non-empty, 
then the union $\cup \mathcal{A}$ is path-connected/connected.

**Proof.** For path-connected sets: let $a$ and $b$ in $\cup \mathcal{A}$.
There are some sets $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $a \in A$ and 
$b\in B$. Let $c \in A \cap B$. There is a path of $A$ that joins $a$ and $b$ 
and a path of $B$ that joins $c$ and $b$; their sum joins $a$ and $b$ in 
$\cup \mathcal{A}$. Hence, this set is path-connected.

For connected sets: let $(D_a)_{a \in \cup \mathcal{A}}$ be a collection of 
non-empty open disks centered on $a$. 
Let $\mathcal{A}'$ be the collection of all sets 
$A' = \cup_{a \in A} D_a$ when $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
Every such set is path-connected. 
Moreover, for every sets $A'$ and $B'$ in $\mathcal{A}'$, 
$A' \cap B'$ is non-empty, hence $\cup_{a \in \cup \mathcal{A}} D_a
= \cup \mathcal{A}'$ is path-connected,
therefore $\cup \mathcal{A}'$ is connected. \hfill $\blacksquare$ 

**Theorem -- Disjoint Union of Open Sets.** If $A$ and $B$ are two non-empty
open sets such that $A \cap B = \varnothing$, then $A \cup B$ is not
path-connected/connected.

**Proof.** Assume that $\gamma$ is a path of $A \cup B$ that joins a $a \in A$ 
and a $b \in B$. Consider the function 
  $$
  \phi : t\in [0,1] \mapsto d(\gamma(t), A) - d(\gamma(t), B).
  $$ 
It is continuous,
$\phi(0) < 0$ and $\phi(1) > 0$, consequently by the intermediate value
theorem, there is a $t\in\left]0,1\right[$ such that $t = 0$, that
is $d(\gamma(t),A) = d(\gamma(t), B)$. But this is not possible: if
$\gamma(t) \in A$, $d(\gamma(t), A)=0$ and as $A$ is open and 
$B \subset \complement A$, $d(\gamma(t), B) > 0$, hence $\phi(t)$ should
be negative; by a similar argument, if $\gamma(t) \in B$, $\phi(t)$ should
be positive. Hence no such path can exist and $A \cup B$ is not path-connected;
as $A \cup B$ is open it is not connected either.
\hfill $\blacksquare$ 

However, connected sets also have some interesting properties that are not 
shared with all path-connected sets; for example:

**Theorem.** The closure of a connected set is connected.

**Proof.** Let $A$ be a connected set and let $(D_b)_{b \in \overline{A}}$ be a 
collection of non-empty open disks centered on $b\in \overline{A}$. For any
$b \in \overline{A}$, the distance $d_b$ between $b$ and the complement
of $\cup_{b \in \overline{A}} D_b$, a closed set, is positive. 
The collection $(D(a, d_a))_{a \in A}$ is a collection of non-empty disks
centered on $a \in A$. By construction, $\cup_{a \in A} D(a, d_a)$ is subset
of $\cup_{b \in \overline{A}} D_b$. The converse inclusion also holds:
if $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of points of $A$ such that
$a_n \to b \in \overline{A}$ when $n \to +\infty$, the continuity of the
distance yields $d_{a_n} \to d_{b}$, hence 
$D_b \subset D(b, d_b) \subset \cup_{n \in N} D(a_n, d_{a_n})$ and
consequently $D_b \subset \cup_{a \in A} D(a, d_a)$.
As $A$ is connected, $\cup_{a \in A}D(a, d_a)$ is path-connected, 
hence $\cup_{b \in \overline{A}} D_b$ is connected and $\overline{A}$ is
connected. \hfill $\blacksquare$

The equivalent statement is false for some path-connected sets. 
Actually, we may leverage this difference to build a connected set 
that is not path-connected:

**Example -- The Topologist's Sine Curve.** 
Consider 
  $$
  A = \{(t, \sin 2\pi/t)  \; | \; t \in \left] 0, 1 \right]\}.
  $$
It its path-connected -- 
as the image by a continuous function of a path-connected set -- 
hence its closure $\overline{A} = A \cup \{(0,y) \; | \; y \in [-1, +1] \}$
is connected; 
however, it is not path-connected,
there is for example no path of $\overline{A}$ that joins $(1,0)$ and $(0,0)$.

![The Topologist's Sine Curve.](images/topologist-sine-curve.pdf)

Indeed, assume on the contrary that such a path $\gamma$ exists. 
As $\Re \gamma(0) = 1$ and $\Re \gamma(1) =0$,
by the intermediate value theorem, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$,
there is a $t_n$ in $\left] 0,1 \right[$ such that 
$\Re \gamma(t_n) = (n/2 + 5/4)^{-1} \in \left] 0, 1 \right[$. 
More precisely, applying the intermediate value theorem recursively 
to the interval $]0, t_n[$ to find $t_{n+1}$ ensures that
we can select a decreasing sequence $t_n$ with this property.
As $A$ is the graph of a function, $\Re \gamma(t_n)$ determines uniquely
$\Im \gamma(t_n)$: $\Im \gamma(t_n) = \sin 2\pi/t_n
=(-1)^n.$
As the sequence of $t_n$ is strictly decreasing and bounded from below, 
necessarily $|t_{n+1} - t_n| \to 0$ when $n \to +\infty$. 
But on the other hand, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, 
$$|\gamma(t_{n+1})- \gamma(t_n)| \geq
|\Im \gamma(t_{n+1})- \Im\gamma(t_n)| = 2,$$
hence the function $\gamma$, despite being continuous and defined on the 
compact set $[0,1]$ cannot be uniformly continuous, which is a contradiction.


Components
================================================================================

We define two concepts of components based respectively on path-connectedness 
and connectedness.

**Definition -- Component.** 
A *(path-connected/connected) component* of a set $A$ is a subset of $A$ 
which is path-connected/connected and maximal with respect to inclusion among 
such sets -- 
that is, included in no other path-connected/connected subset of $A$.

Clearly, a non-empty set is path-connected/connected if and only if it has a 
single (path-connected/connected) component.

**Theorem -- Partition into Components.** 
The (path-connected/connected) components of a set $A$ are a partition of $A$: 
they are a collection of non-empty and pairwise disjoint subsets of $A$ 
whose union is $A$.

**Proof.** The proof is identical for path-connected and connected components,
for the sake of brevity, we state it only for connected components.

Let $a \in A$. Consider the collection $\mathcal{A}_a$ off all 
connected subsets of $A$ that contain $a$.
The set $A_a = \cup \mathcal{A}_a$ is connected.
By construction, the set $A_a$ is maximal: it is a component of $A$. 
As every component of $A$ is maximal, it contains at least one point 
$a \in A$: it is therefore non-empty and equal to $A_a$. 
Hence the union of all components of $A$ is $\cup_{a \in A} A_a = A$. 
Finally, if two such components $A_a$ and $A_b$ have a non-empty intersection
$c \in A$, the set $A_a \cup A_b$ is connected and contains $A_a$ and $A_b$, 
therefore $A_a = A_b$.
\hfill $\blacksquare$

**Theorem -- Components of Open Sets.** The partitions of an open set into 
path-connected components and connected components are identical.
All such components are open.

**Proof.** **TODO**

\hfill $\blacksquare$

An Alternate Characteristic
================================================================================

**Definition -- Locally Constant Function.** A function $f$ defined on a set $A$
is locally constant if for any $a$ in $A$, there is a non-empty open disk 
centered on $a$ where $f$ is constant:
  $$
  \forall \, a \in A, \; \exists \, \epsilon > 0, \;
  \forall \, b \in A, \; |b-a| < \epsilon \to f(b) = f(a).
  $$

**Theorem.** A set $A$ is connected if and only if every locally constant 
function defined on $A$ is constant.

**Proof.** Let $f$ be a locally constant function defined on $A$.
Let $a \in A$ and $B = \{b \in A \; | \; f(b)=f(a) \}$. Assume that $f$ is
not constant, that is, that $A \setminus B$ is non-empty.
For any
$b \in B$, there is a $\epsilon > 0$ such that $c \in A$ and $|c-b| < \epsilon$
yields $f(c)= f(b)=f(a)$; define $D_b = D(b, r)$ where $r = \min(\epsilon,
d(b, A \setminus B)/2))$. We perform a similar construction for 
$A \setminus B = \{b \in A \; | \; f(b) \neq f(a) \}$: for any $b \in A \setminus
B$, there is a $\epsilon > 0$ such that $c \in A$ and $|c-b| < \epsilon$
yields $f(c)= f(b)$; define $D_b = D(b, r)$ where $r = \min(\epsilon,
d(b, B)/2))$. By construction, the sets 
$\cup_{b \in B} D_b$ and $\cup_{b \in A \setminus B} D_b$ are open, non-empty
and disjoints, hence the collection $(D_b)_{b \in A}$ is not path-connected.
Therefore, $A$ is not connected.

Conversely, if $A$ is not connected, let $(D_a)_{a\in A}$ be a collection of
non-empty open disks centered on $a$ whose union is not path-connected.
Select one component $B$ of $\cup_{a \in A} D_a$, define $C$ as the union
of all other components.
Then, define the function $f$ on $A$ by $f(z)=1$ if $z \in B$ and $f(z)=0$ 
otherwise. As $B$ and $C$ are both open sets, $f$ is locally constant, but
it is not constant. \hfill $\blacksquare$
